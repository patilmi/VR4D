# VR4D

# Purpose
Expand mind to include spatial model/intuition/navigation of four dimensional space

# What/How it does
Rotates a rigid body (4D cube, 4D sphere, 4D plane etc) in four dimensional space while projecting onto a 3Dimensional screen (VR headset)

Objects created as point clouds, points represented by tiny spheres.

# Why it is effective

It is using the same principle that the human brain uses to construct a 3D model/intuition of 3Dimensional space from 2d projections onto our retina.


# How to Run (This needs testing)
Cleanest way to run this code is probably to just start a new Unity VR project with your VR setups recommended settings (link to guide)
add the script files as assets, attach '4dim.cs' to an empty game object and then run. Remove default backgrounds objects in the unity project.

# Why it is unique

There are other projects looking to explore 4D with VR, these mostly operate on the principle of rendering slices of the 4D world.
This project uses a cognitive approach that builds up our intuition organically (through rotation) while slicing loses the continuity that our brain needs to
stitch 3D projections into a 4D whole. 


# Implications

Opens up the world of intuitive 4D problem solving
Huge cognitive space implications: 
  What is happening in the brain when we start to grasp 4D space?
  Brain changes?
  Make us smarter?
  See patterns previously invisible to us?
  4D metaverse?
  
 # Direction
 
 Webapplication that uses brain training app like structure, which allows users to freely manipulate objects and rotations, provides self testing
 functionality to test 4D navigational skills. Match 4D objects from different perspectives/
 Collects data from users, Time spent, session length, effects (Collaboration with cognitive research space)
